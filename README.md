# NeuraCast - RNN Model

<samp>Modeling patient time series data with Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network in keras. Provides probablity of patient survival using electronic health records. Data is preprocessed filling gaps, normalizing features, and padding. A single LSTM using binary cross entropy loss and RMSprop optimizer.</samp>

## Tools/Frameworks Utilized

- `Python` : Primary language for writing neural network model and components
- `Keras` : Neural network API used to define model architecture
- `Tensorflow` : Backend for keras handling NN executions
- `Pandas` : Dataframe used to interact with patient data and preprocessing
